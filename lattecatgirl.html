        <h3 style="color:#ff3d3d;"> Lattecatgirl! </h3>
        <p> She can eat, breathe, snort, fight, hair toss, look, blink, hear, and protect all lattecat species. 5 have already gone extinct! </p>
        <h3 style="color:#ff873d;"> Her powers!! </h4>
        <p> She has the power of making things appear out of nowhere,  punching, throwing, yelling, making you suffer if you disobey the rules, do a ponytail hair toss, make lattes in second, poop out whipped cream, and fart out either magic sprinkles or powdered sugar </p>
        <h3 style="color:#f5cc00;"> Favorite Animals! :3 </h4>
        <p> First of all, puppies are one of my FAVORITE animals. They are super cute, extreeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeelllyyyyyy smart, and are playful. They are good pets that are adorable and are irresistable! </p>

        <p> Another one of my favorite animals is the ermine, otherwise known as the short-tail weasel, or just plain weasel. My favorite type of ermine is the arctic ermine, because I love the white fluffy fur it has. </p>
