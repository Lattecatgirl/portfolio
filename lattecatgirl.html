    <h4 style="color: #e500ff"> What my weaknesses are :( </h4>
    <p> I can't not do anything if you understand that, which you probably don't and so now you don't know my weakness and also I can't resist lattes because they are the best thing in the world well not really but some people, weird people like moms or whatever they are called like to drink lattes, and they are dangerous because some moms like to drink lattes with girl cats inside of them, and I am scared to be eaten/drinked so yah. </p>
