        <h3 style="color: #e500ff;"> Lattecatgirl! </h3>
        <p> She can eat, breathe, snort, fight, hair toss, look, blink, hear, and protect all lattecat species. 5 have already gone extinct! </p>
        <h3 style="color: #e500ff;"> Her powers!! </h4>
        <p> She has the power of making things appear out of nowhere,  punching, throwing, yelling, making you suffer if you disobey the rules, do a ponytail hair toss, make lattes in second, poop out whipped cream, and fart out either magic sprinkles or powdered sugar </p>
        <h3 style="color: #e500ff;"> Favorite Animals! :3 </h4>
        <p> First of all, puppies are one of my FAVORITE animals. They are super cute, extreeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeelllyyyyyy smart, and are playful. They are good pets that are adorable and are irresistable! </p>

        <h3 style="color: #e500ff;"> What my weaknesses are :( </h4>
        <p> I can't not do anything if you understand that, which you probably don't and so now you don't know my weakness and also I can't resist lattes because they are the best thing in the world well not really but some people, weird people like moms or whatever they are called like to drink lattes, and they are dangerous because some moms like to drink lattes with girl cats inside of them, and I am scared to be eaten/drinked so yah. </p>
