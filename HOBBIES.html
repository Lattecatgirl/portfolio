      <h3 style="color #ff0059"> Art 🎨 </h3>
      <p> Art is one of my favorite hobbies because it lets me either sketch, paint, or draw whatever I wish for, and also practicing with challenges also boost my creativity skills. </p>

      <h3 style="color #ff0059"> Sports🏃‍ </h3>
      <p> Some of my favorite sports include tennis and swimming. Tennis, I like competing against other players and getting better at the accuracy of where the ball goes. Swimming is another one of my favorite hobbies because I like to swim, just to play around and to compete in 'swim meets' when other swim teams come over to our pool to compete. I enjoy playing these sports, and yah, these are two of my most favorite sports. :D </p>
      <h3 style="color #ff0059"> Reading 😊 </h3>
      <p> I love reading books, genre including mystery/suspense, comic, funny things, mostly fiction, historical fiction, fantasy, and etc. Books are a fun thing to read, and I love reading each book, and figuring out the plot of the story, so just builds up the suspense of reading. Sometimes, the suspense is so strong, that I stay stay awake for longer than needed hours just to finish my book. Yah, I'm like that. I like enjoying ma books. 😎 </p>
