     <h3 style="color #ff0059"> Art </h3>
      <p> Art is one of my favorite hobbies because it lets me either sketch, paint, or draw whatever I wish for, and also practicing with challenges also boost my creativity skills. </p>
      <h3 style="color #ff0059"> Sports </h3>
      <p> Some of my favorite sports include tennis and swimming. Tennis, I like competing against other players and getting better at the accuracy of where the ball goes. Swimming is another one of my favorite hobbies because I like to swim, just to play around and to compete in 'swim meets' when other swim teams come over to our pool to compete. I enjoy playing these sports, and yah, these are two of my most favorite sports. :D </p>
